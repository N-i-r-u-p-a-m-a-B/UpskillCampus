#Used Libraries #Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation, built on top of the NumPy package. Its key data structure, the DataFrame, facilitates the manipulation of tabular data. Pandas offers a wide range of functions for data analysis, including reading and writing data from various sources, cleaning data, and merging datasets. NumPy is another Python library essential for scientific computing and data analysis, providing efficient operations on arrays and matrices. Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization, offering functions to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations, and is built on top of NumPy. Seaborn, based on Matplotlib, provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Scikit-learn is a library that supplies a wide range of machine learning algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning. To utilize these libraries, you can import them with the following commands: import numpy as np, import pandas as pd, from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and import seaborn as sns. Including %matplotlib inline allows plots to appear directly in the notebook.
